# Duplicacy Autobackup

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/christophetd/duplicacy-autobackup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/christophetd/duplicacy-autobackup)  [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/christophetd/duplicacy-autobackup.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/christophetd/duplicacy-autobackup "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

Duplicacy Autobackup is a Docker image to easily perform automated backups. It uses [duplicacy](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy) under the hood, and therefore supports:

- Multiple storage backends: S3, Backblaze B2, Hubic, Dropbox, SFTP...
- Client-side encryption
- Deduplication
- Multi-versioning
- ... and more generally, all the features that duplicacy has.

## Usage

The following environment variables can be used to configure the backup strategy.

- `BACKUP_NAME`: The name of your backup (should be unique, e.g. `prod-db-backups`)
- `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: An optional passphrase to encrypt your backups with before they are stored remotely.
- `BACKUP_SCHEDULE`: Cron-like string to define the frequency at which backups should be made (e.g. `0 2 * * *` for `Every day at 2am`). Note that this string should be indicated in the UTC timezone.
- `BACKUP_LOCATION`: [Duplicacy URI](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Storage-Backends) of where to store the backups.
    - S3: `s3://region@amazon.com/bucket/path/to/storage`
    - Backblaze B2: `b2://my-bucket/`
    - ...

Additionally, the directory you want to backup must be mounted to `/data` on the container.

You need to provide credentials for the storage provider your of your choice using the following environment variables:

- AWS S3: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
- Backblaze B2: `B2_ID` and `B2_KEY`
- Dropbox: `DROPBOX_TOKEN`
- Azure: `AZURE_KEY`
- Google Cloud Datastore: `GCD_TOKEN`
- SSH/SFTP: `SSH_PASSWORD` or `SSH_KEY_FILE`*
- Hubic: `HUBIC_TOKEN_FILE`*
- Google Cloud Storage: `GCS_TOKEN_FILE`*
- Onedrive: `ONEDRIVE_TOKEN_FILE`*
- Wasabi: `WASABI_KEY` and `WASABI_SECRET`

*Environment variables marked with an asterix point to files. Those files must be mounted in the container so that they can be accessed from inside it*.

If you want to execute an out of schedule backup, you can do so by running the script `/app/backup.sh` inside the container :

``` 
$ docker exec duplicacy-autobackup /app/duplicacy-autobackup.sh backup
```

## Example

Backup `/var/lib/mysql` to the S3 bucket `xtof-db-backups` in the AWS region `eu-west-1` every night at 2:00am, and encrypt them with the passphrase `correct horse battery staple`:

```bash
$ docker run -d --name duplicacy-autobackup \
    -v /var/lib/mysql:/data \
    -e BACKUP_NAME='prod-db-backups' \
    -e BACKUP_LOCATION='s3://eu-west-1@amazon.com/xtof-db-backups' \
    -e BACKUP_SCHEDULE='0 2 * * *' \
    -e BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY='correct horse battery staple' \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AKIA...' \
    -e AWS_SECRET_KEY='...' \
    christophetd/duplicacy-autobackup
```

## Viewing and restoring backups

Backups are useless if you don't make sure they work. This shows the procedure to list files, versions, and restore a duplicacy backup made using duplicacy-autobackup.

- Install Duplicacy: download the latest Duplicacy binary from its [Github page](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/releases), and put it in your path

- `cd` to a directory where you'll restore your files, e.g. `/tmp/restore`

- Run `duplicacy init backup_name backup_location`, where `backup_name` and `backup_location` correspond to the `BACKUP_NAME` and `BACKUP_LOCATION` environment variables of your setup.
    - **If you used client-side encryption, add the `-encrypt` flag**: `duplicacy init -encrypt backup_name backup_location`

  You will get a prompt asking for your storage provider's credentials, and, if applicable, your encryption key:

  ```
  Enter S3 Access Key ID: *****
  Enter S3 Secret Access Key: *************
  Enter storage password for s3://eu-west-1@amazon.com/xtof-db-backups:*******************
  The storage 's3://eu-west-1@amazon.com/xtof-db-backups' has already been initialized
  Compression level: 100
  Average chunk size: 4194304
  Maximum chunk size: 16777216
  Minimum chunk size: 1048576
  Chunk seed: fc7e56fb91f8f66b01ba033ec6f7b128bcb3420c66a31468a4f3541407d569bd
  /tmp/restore will be backed up to s3://eu-west-1@amazon.com/xtof-db-backups with id db-backups
  ```

- To list the versions of your backups, run:

  ```
  $ duplicacy list
  Storage set to s3://eu-west-1@amazon.com/xtof-db-backups
  Enter storage password:*******************
  Snapshot db-backups revision 1 created at 2018-04-19 09:47 -hash
  Snapshot db-backups revision 2 created at 2018-04-19 09:48 
  Snapshot db-backups revision 3 created at 2018-04-19 09:49 
  ```

- To view the files of a particular revision, run:

  ```bash
  $ duplicacy list -files -r 2  # 2 is the revision number
  ```

- To restore in the current directory all the files matching `*.txt` of the revision 2 of the backup, run:

  ```bash
  $ duplicacy restore -r 2 '*.txt'
  ```

- To restore in the current directory the whole revision 2 of your backup, run:

  ```
  $ duplicacy restore -r 2
  ```

## Other options

You can have duplicacy-autobackup run a script before and after the backup process by mounting scripts on `/scripts/pre-backup.sh` and `/scripts/post-backup.sh`. For instance if you're backing up a MySQL database, this script can involve doing a `mysqldump` into `/data/mydb.sql`. If `pre-backup.sh` exits with a non-zero status code, the backup will not be performed until the next scheduled backup.

Use the following environment variables if you want to customize duplicacy's behavior.

- `BACKUP_IMMEDIATELY` (`yes`/`no`): indicates if a backup should be performed immediately after the container is started. Equivalent to launching the container and then running `docker exec duplicacy-autobackup /app/duplicacy-autobackup.sh backup`. By default, `no`.
- `DUPLICACY_INIT_OPTIONS`: options passed to `duplicacy init` the first time a backup is made. By default, `-encrypt` if `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is not empty.
- `DUPLICACY_BACKUP_OPTIONS`: options passed to `duplicacy backup` when a backup is performed. By default: `-threads 4 -stats`. **If you are backing up a hard drive (and not a SSD), it is recommended to use `-threads 1 -stats` instead** (see [here](https://duplicacy.com/issue?id=5670666258874368) for more details).

### Pruning old backups

Duplicacy offers an option to [prune](https://forum.duplicacy.com/t/prune-command-details/1005) old backups. By default, duplicacy-autobackup does _not_ perform any pruning. However, you can set the environment variables `DUPLICACY_PRUNE_OPTIONS` and `PRUNE_SCHEDULE` to perform automatic pruning. As an example, setting:

```
DUPLICACY_PRUNE_OPTIONS='-keep 0:360 -keep 30:180 -keep 7:30'
PRUNE_SCHEDULE='0 0 * * *'
```

Means that:
- Every day at midnight, the pruning process runs
- When the pruning process runs...
   - Any backup older than 1 year is deleted from the remote storage
   - Only 1 backup per 30 days is kept for backups between 180 days and 360 days old
   - Only 1 backup per 7 days is kept for backups between 7 days and 180 days old
   - 1 backup per day is kept for backups between 0 day and 7 days old


 See the [prune command details](https://forum.duplicacy.com/t/prune-command-details/1005) for further details.


## Choosing the Duplicacy version

When building the container, you can choose the Duplicacy version that will be used in the container image. The build argument `DUPLICACY_VERSION` is available for that purpose, e.g.:

```
docker build --build-arg DUPLICACY_VERSION=2.1.0 -t christophetd/duplicacy-autobackup .
```
